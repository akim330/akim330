# Hey there! I'm Andrew Kim 
**Data Scientist · ML Enthusiast · Game Dev Dabbler**

I'm passionate about building **practical, data-driven tools** that solve real problems—especially in **healthcare**. I enjoy tackling the entire data workflow: from cleaning and modeling to deploying and scaling pipelines. 

Outside of data science, I love **game development** (Unity, pixel art, procedural generation) and occasionally compose music for fun.
