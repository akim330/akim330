## 👋 Hello
**Data Scientist | ML Engineer | Game Dev Enthusiast**  

I’m a former Senior Data Scientist at J2 Health, where I built solutions that solved real-world healthcare challenges—like predicting regulatory adequacy determinations (99% accuracy!) and scaling data pipelines to handle 5x more clients. Outside of healthcare analytics, I’m passionate about **game development** (Unity, pixel art, procedural generation) and enjoy crafting interactive experiences.

## 🚀 What I’ve Done
- **Healthcare Data Science:**  
  - 🧠 **Network Adequacy Algorithm:** Achieved **99% accuracy**, unlocking **$6M ARR**  
  - ⚙️ **End-to-End Data Pipelines:** Reduced client turnaround from **24 hours to 5–30 minutes**  
  - 📊 **Provider Database Management:** Managed **2M+ records** with **DBT** & **Dagster**  

- **Machine Learning & MLOps:**  
  - Built custom ML models (neural networks, spline interpolation)  
  - Hands-on with **Google Cloud, BigQuery, SQL, DBT, Dagster, Python**  

- **Game Development:**  
  - 🎮 **Unity Projects:** Procedural village generator, pixel-art platformers  
  - 🎼 **Creative Work:** Music composition & 2D pixel art
